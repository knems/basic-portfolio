        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>My adventure started off when I was quite young. In the beginning, I played a MMO called ROBLOX.
					In a quick summary the games consist of two major dynamics. The first being the players community
					which I will not go into detail for its irrelevance in this context. On the other hand, there is the
					developer side. This community builds the playable games to the users off the LUA functional programming language.
					In hindsight, this is where I was first exposed to a "Hello World" print function and the basics of programming.</p>
				<p>Over the years I've gained experience building websites in a basic web pages class in 2015 In high school.. Though
				I didn't entirely learn much I did expose me to Web Development</p>
				<p>From there I started educating myself by majoring in IT through Arizona State University. While I did learn a lot of relevant topics such as
				big O'notation, JAVA, Python, and basic data structures, it was too slow of a pace.</p>
				<p>My focus has been developing projects on github, actively seeking opportunities for an entry level developer</p>
				<p>I have primarily focused on learning the MEAN stack, while I am now turning towards advancing my front-end skills I will start building small
				applications better suiting for applying for positions</p>

				<strong>I'd love to hear from you!</strong>
